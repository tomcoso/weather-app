# Weather app project from The Odin Project

### [Live demo](https://tomcoso.github.io/weather-app/)

The project uses the Openweather API and the Geoapify API to find a the city and request current weather and forecast. The information displayed it very minimalistic, just displaying the bare minimum according to my personal taste. Expanding the project always remains possible.

I added a switching background picture (with every reload and display repopulation) to my personal taste, since I didn't like representative weather backgrounds.
